Hi there!!!... Welcome to my first blog. 

My name’s Brittany!  I’m 28 years old, a passionate teacher, and a life-long learner. I became interested in coding when I was in high school and took a coding course as an elective my senior year. I loved it and caught on quickly… I wish I would have taken the course earlier so that I could have learned more before graduating!   I would finish up projects early and help others in the classroom.  It’s what I wanted to go to college for, but ended up studying my other passion, mathematics!

Once I graduated, I became a corps member with Teach for America and taught high school math to disadvantaged students in Charleston, South Carolina. I quickly learned that helping my students improve their high school math skills wasn’t enough, many students go on to graduate and still struggle once they get to college.  This was unsettling to me because I saw firsthand how hard my students worked, only to get to college and struggle again.  Therefore, while I was teaching, I received my MBA and transitioned out of the classroom to work for an Ed tech company that specialized in creating mathematics software for college students.  I found myself fascinated with how our teams of developers worked together to continuously build and improve our courseware for students.  This sparked the fire in me to continue with my interest in coding.  I practice coding on my own when I can and have learned a bit on HTML5.

My goal for my career and future is to become a developer so that I can help to create and improve the experience for all users. Once I’ve started my career in tech, I would also like help tutor and train other woman and high school students who are interested in getting started too.  I know I’m nervous to get started, but excited to begin this journey, so once I’m more comfortable with my career, I would love to help others who might feel the same way!
