Today was a great start to my week!..it definately wasn't a Manic Monday. After working on my first Flatiron School Project over the weekend, I'm officially done. It's actually crazy to think.  when I first opened IDE and saw a blank page staring back on me, I was feeling a bit anxious.  I knew I wanted to make a CLI gem that I could use often, but the possabilities were endless, and starting from scratch with no tests specs letting me know I was on the right track was scray!  However, after watching the video resources and reading the GitHub repos provided as examples, I had an idea of what I wanted my project to be and felt confident in what I'd learned so far. 

Idea- Help keep myself on track with my New Year's Resolution.  I want to read at least one book a month. Once I dive into a book, I can't put it down, however finding a new book can take some time.  So my CLI gem gives me the list of the top 20 best selling books on Amazon for the week. I can then pick the book that sounds interesting and my gem will give me the:
*Author
* Rating/reviews
* URL to read a sample of the book
* URL to listen to an audible sample of the book
* Summary
* Purchasing page on Amazon

Once I had my idea in mind, it was time to start organizing.  I was so thankful for Flatiron's video resources on this part.  I started with a  rough draft on my CLI and of how I wanted the user to interact with it.  From there, I worked on my Book class that would instantiate new books.  I started with fake data pretending it is what I scraped from Amazon's site.  This took a bit of time because I couldn't get the instances I was making in my Book class to populate into my cli.rb and display to the user.  Luckily, all of the labs I've worked on this far at Flatiron built up to this project.  So I went back trough my old projects to see how I did this in other scenerios.  Once I was able to get  my book.rb to interact with my cli.rb and everything was appearing in my CLI, then came the fun part!...Nokogiri!  

At first, I only planned to have the author, rating, and link to puchase the book, but I started to have so much fun with all of the useful information that Amazon gave, I couldn't help but add in more.  This project was one of the most challenging and rewarding things I've done so far.  I was so excited when my CLI gem worked correctly for the first time and now that I'm done with this Gem, I keep thinking of others that I can make for fun!
