When I made it to the 75% mark in the curriculum, I was so excited! It felt almost like a mini graduation when the carreer and graduation dashboards appeared.  At first, though excited, I was a little nervous for searching for a job.  Luckily, just like everything else in the Flatiron curriculum, the Career Prep curriculum has been wonderful!  

## Job Search Prep!
#### Organize Your Online Precense
I've applied to a few jobs now and they have all asked for the same sites, so put in the extra time at the beginning to make sure your sites are up to date and represent the most important things that you would want a hiring manager or recruiter to learn about you!
* GitHub 
* Blog 
* LinkedIn 
* Twitter 
  
#### Create Your Resume and Cover Letter
Creating this resume was a lot different than the one I created for teaching in the past, but once I saw the template and started adding my information, I sarted to gain confidence in my skills and realize I was ready to start applying to jobs! Maybe it was the "imposter syndrom" kicking in before, but seeing all of my projects, skills, and languages I've learned written on paper now gave me the extra boost I neeeded to feel ready to start applying for jobs! 

* Spend time on the little things!  One of my favortie parts of my resume are my projects and for each project I have a link to the reop on guthub and to my youtube video demo.  So spend time making sure your Readme/description is organized and that you're happy withthe video demo highlighting your project in the best let!  
 
#### Networking is Key 
Networking seemed a bit scary to me, I liked going to meetups that had an agenda, but going to something that I needed to mingle at the entire time was a different story.  But, I gave it a try and it worked really well! I think of it now like a domino effect.  For example, I met a developer who in turn, let me know of two openings at his company, explained more about his company, and introduced me to a new meetup.

I've just started the Job search journey, but I'm excited to document my path and looking forward to landing my first job!
