Deciding to become a developer was one of the biggest leaps I've taken so far in life! After making this decision, I quickly realized that another big decision I've had o make is where I wanted to start.  For example, want languages to start with.  So far, these have been the bests sites that I've used to get started:

* FreeCodeCamp - Really popular site where people go to start learning how to code. It has a curriculum map that starts off with the basics and you can build your way up to more advanced stuff - all free! https://www.freecodecamp.org/signin

* CodeAcademy - You can pay to do their intensive programs, or you can start any of their courses for free. I recommend starting with html and css, but it doesn't give as much content as #1. https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/subject/web-development. 

* Udacity - They have free web development courses like this intro to HTML and CSS.  https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-html-and-css--ud001

* Flatiron -   This is the site that I'm using now. They have a free bootcamp prep course that goes over a little of html and css and back languages like Ruby and Javascript.   They have a great curriculum and give a lot of support.  If you decide you like coding and want to apply for their Web development bootcamp, they have a lot of scholarships for women where they'll pay any where for 50-100% of the cost.  https://flatironschool.com/programs/online-bootcamp-prep-course/

I found this roadmap online that also helps to set goals and figure out what languages to learn next!!  https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_5e341lLJGwUDhaV2hTTWVSSFBLVEQtSlhZQVY0a2NNT3lF/view?usp=sharing
